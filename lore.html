    <h1>why notes?</h1>

    <div class="post">
        i used to watch these youtube videos called "notes on a scene" where directors and actors would
        go back through different scenes in a film and annotate them. i kinda wanted to do the same thing
        with my DJ sets. but mostly, i just wanted to remember what i was thinking and feeling when i was
        making the set, during the set, after the set. just all of that. making these sets are kinda like
        a bookmark in time for me since you know like whenever you listen to a song it takes you back?
        well, these DJ sets do that for me x1000000.

    <h1>dj lore</h1>

    <div class="post">
        so back when i was in college, i made a deal with my parents that if i was able
        to make a business out of DJing, that they would pay for my DJ controller. so we shook hands
        and made the deal. i had my first gig and that was for my friend's grandma's
        birthday party held in a church reception hall. i'm playing Filipino line dances and it was LIT.<br/><br/>

        buuuuuut, studying electrical engineering became tough and i didn't have
        a lot of time to do that. i thought dj career ended there.<br/><br/>

        fast forward to 2023, i'm living in san francisco and i'm seeing all these DJs at house parties and
        Dolores Park and i'm watching boiler room and i'm INSPIRED. i watch a 100 gecs boiler room and Laura
        Les is using a TINY controller. i'm thinking if 100 gecs can use that, i could probably use that too. <br/><br/>

        they mixed a bunch of different genres and i was really loving 100 gecs and hyperpop at the time (i still do),
        so i grabbed that controller and started mixing music and sent some clips to my friends. soon enough, my friends
        start DJing too and then it was time to find some shows to play to practice. i'm playing my friend's bday
        parties and i'm also hosting my own private shows with some friends. <br/><br/>

        and well... you can read the rest of history in the notes.
