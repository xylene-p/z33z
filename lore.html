    <h1>why notes?</h1>

    <div class="post">
        i used to watch these youtube videos called "notes on a scene" where directors and actors would
        go back through different scenes in a film and annotate them. i kinda wanted to do the same thing
        with my DJ sets. but mostly, i just wanted to remember what i was thinking and feeling when i was
        making the set, during the set, after the set. just all of that. making these sets are kinda like
        a bookmark in time for me since you know like whenever you listen to a song it takes you back?
        well, these DJ sets do that for me x1000000.
