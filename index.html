    <p>z33z notes on a set</p>
    <div class="post">
      march 01 2024 <br />
      <div class="post-title">the night market set</div>
      it's two weeks before the end of March and i'm trying to think about my
      next dj set so that i can keep up with the one-mix-a-month rule that i set
      for myself. i wanted to keep myself accountable on remaining consisent
      with my djing hobby. my friend asks me to dj for his "night market" event,
      so it really worked out because it definitely boosts my motivation to go
      out there a perform my sets and not just make some and play them in my
      bedroom. the event rules were pretty cool. if you haven't read "the art of
      the gathering" and wanted to learn how to make successful, more inclusive
      events, i'd recommend the summary at least bc i didn't read it, only the
      summary üòù. but i think the suggestions it provided are very useful to
      know when planning a gathering that's more than just a party. <br /><br />

      RULES OF THE MARKET<br />
      1. Bring a bag of goodies<br />
      2. Trade, barter, & haggle (anything but money)<br />
      3. Enjoy a lineup of 6 deadly DJs<br />
      4. First trade happens at the door!<br /><br />

      I traded some solar eclipse glasses and various flavors of mintia and
      ended up with a casette tape (i still gotta find a casette player), an MW
      hat (a brand from a movie called Beau is Afraid), an origami crane.
      <br /><br />

      Now onto the set...<br /><br />
      <hr />
      <br />
      i sometimes find it difficult to convey how i feel. there's sometimes a
      <br />l <br />a <br /><br />g between experiencing the feeling and the
      moment that i'm trying to express it ((suppression)). in my past dj sets,
      i've mostly been focused on the technical aspect of the music -- the
      groove, the harmonics, making loops that sound good on top of other loops
      and the transitions between the songs. this time, i made this set with the
      intention of focusing on the emotional aspect of the music and feelings
      that i have longed to express. everyone interprets, feels, and reacts to
      music differently but i wanted to guide the listener on a journey by
      incorporating a theme. this set reflects some emotions that i felt in the
      past and sometimes felt like i experience them again and again and again
      and again and again and again. i won't try to explain away those feelings
      with words here because i think that defeats the purpose of the set.<br /><br />

      i've found that playing songs that have synth pads are suuuper expressive
      for me which is really nice. and i also find spoken word and vocals which
      almost sound like synth pads, like you can barely make out the words that
      are in the song, but you can still feel the emotion behind it is very
      powerful. i also tried experimenting with slowing down songs a bunch to
      see if it could sound synthy with some reverb applied.<br /><br />

      i'm noticing a pattern in the way i make my sets. i have a core song that
      i use as the anchor. this one is "us ephemeral". i usually think of this
      core song as the center -- something that i want to build towards and then
      after give the listener a lingering feeling of that song in the songs that
      follow. kind of repeating some elements later from this core song. for
      this one, i wanted to start out with more ambient, melancholic songs. then
      building up some energy with the more upbeat songs. "fleeting frozen
      heart" has a very nice piano riff mixed with some chill drum and bass,
      which i think fit well to give the listener a bit of pause but also
      maintaining some energy. "comfort zone" i didn't really feel like the
      lyrics fit the theme but the synth pad is great. "loving is easy" i
      included this track because it represents confusion to me. i wanted to end
      with a soft, optimistic-leaning euphoria so "dhollandia" went in. i really
      like the vocals, the lil zaps and the accents on the beat near the end.<br /><br />

      i've included the pre-recording and the live set, which has the mistakes
      and all (unintended faster BPMs) and an extra song bc i had to fill until
      the next dj came.<br /><br />

      i changed my dj name to z33z. finding a new dj name was pretty tough. i
      went through a lot of ideas and i was really indecisive and had a fear of
      being cringe.<br /><br />

      i'm an internet kid. i grew up on the internet.<br />
      punk_flip93 was my first online name that i can remember.<br />
      then it was xagent001<br />
      then xunderground<br />
      stolenpens (ppl really did steal my pens when i was in elementary
      school)<br />
      exmachina47<br />
      k-pez<br />
      kdashpez<br />
      machinablaze<br />
      katsudotsh<br />
      katsubi<br />
      <i
        >i didn't really want my dj name to be tech related because i was
        feeling a bit disconnected from it at the time</i
      ><br />
      <i
        >i quickly wanted to change my name. anything but katsu.sh. i didn't
        want to be dj kat, the shell script. </i
      ><br />
      <i
        >i was thinking about stuff i loved and i thought about chicken katsu,
        my fav food of all time. shoutout to saku (vancouver) and demiya
        (cupertino). katsu was taken. ugh. so i thought of another food i liked,
        which is musubi and combined the two. katsubi. </i
      ><br />
      <i
        >and so i continued to dj and i started to feel like katsubi didn't
        really fit the music i was playing or how i even felt. i was working on
        my 4-track demo tape and i wanted to release it but not under the name
        katsubi. </i
      ><br />
      the letter z, it's the last letter in my name. it's also the last letter
      of the alphabet. symbolizing the end. i also wanted to symbolize a heart
      in there -- the heart that grows üíó and pay my respects to my internet
      origins which gave me such affliction for naming myself. &lt;33 is kind of
      an annoying symbol to have in your name and i thought -- how would people
      even pronounce that? so i made the heart with a z33. i wanted to symbolize
      a bit of asymmetry. so i added another z. and there we have it. z33z.
      zeeeeez. what's z33z? zeez nuts (ok i'll leave now) <br /><br />
      it may be cringe in 5 years but u know what? don't kill the part of u that
      is cringe, kill the part that cringes.
      <br /><br />
      until next time, z33z

      <div class="post-title">the shake house set</div>
      dear friend, have u ever been to a techno rave? i went to one a couple
      months ago and i was honestly surprised there was something going on until
      7am in SF. i went to the show and it was on the second floor of this
      house. i hadn‚Äôt really listened to much techno before. i went to the show
      with a couple friends. it felt like i was in a dark box of repetitive
      music. was kinda ehhh. i feel a bit diff about techno now.
      <br /><br />
      <img src="./umami-sf.jpeg" class="responsive" />
      <br /><br />
      fast forward to july. my friend tells me he wants me to play a techno set
      and make it `apocalyptic trancey powerful` `like music that will make
      people shut up and dance` `and not network` i hoped that exploring outside
      music genres that i was comfortable with would help me find my style and i
      just wanted to give techno another chance bc maybe my initial feelings
      about it had changed im sitting in my friend‚Äôs living room and we‚Äôre
      working on our techno DJ sets together. i realize that my setlist is
      absolute garbagio. and my friend is pretty good at mixing even tho he just
      started learning not too long ago. i went back to my place and actually
      CRAMMED/SPEED-RUN listened to a bunch of techno sets to build my set. not
      sure if i wanna work this chaotically before a show every time but i felt
      like i had a lot more focus this time and it felt amazing now we‚Äôre at THE
      SHAKE HOUSE, which is really just my friend‚Äôs house but he spent a good
      amount of time decorating it and it looked hella SICK there was fog
      machine. the smoke alarm went off a couple times. the DJ controller was
      set up on top of a pool table and we got massiv speakers. and we got red
      m00d lighting. i ended up improvising a bit bc we were running late on our
      DJ schedule and i was getting tired of my own set while i was playing it
      lol. i was also getting physically tired, idk my leg was cramping while i
      was standing up there lmao. i started stretching during my set üôÉ
      <br /><br />
      i should eat more bananas ü§î

      <div class="post-title">the chill summer rager rooftop set</div>
      dear friend, i was watching a video of my most recent fav electronic music
      duo <a href="http://bodysync.world">http://bodysync.world</a> playing a
      set in new york city and then i heard this super catchy eurodancey riff‚Ä¶
      and that was the beginning of the inspiration for this set. i kinda wanna
      get a mini dv camcorder now after watching this vid. also, bodysync is
      playing tonight in SF, pls go if you‚Äôre there :‚Äô) i will enjoy it
      vicariously if u do and wait patiently for the next bodysync set near me
      or will just go try to find them.
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RTfGWyuUfU"
        >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RTfGWyuUfU</a
      >
      i shazamed the riff and it lead me to ‚ÄúWork It‚Äù by Dance System and off i
      went to building the set. i went through allllll the different songs
      (remixes) that had this same sample and ended up choosing ‚ÄúLet Me Show
      You‚Äù Klubbheads remix by Camisra. this set was part of a lineup that i
      hosted for my other DJ friends. i hosted a rooftop party and had a lineup
      of 5 DJs!!! for extra spice, we added a PROJECTOR to the live set and
      projected it on the half-wall behind the DJ table. was definitely a vibe
      and all the videos went nicely with the music that was playing.
      <br /><br />

      (at this point pls listen to the set before reading the retrospective bc
      spoiler, or don‚Äôt! do whatever u want but there may be some bias from
      reading this thing below ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø) <br /><br />

      a bit of a DJ set retrospective, i was a bit (~~baja~~) blasted during
      this set since this set was performed live on the rooftop of my apartment
      building and i was just having a fun time with some friends. so some of
      the transitions are superrrr rough. but listening back to this i can
      definitely still learn from it and get ideas for the next set. i kinda
      like the busy sections a bit more now, kinda reflects a more chaotic
      sound. i shouldn‚Äôt just cut to vocals with no bass when transitioning from
      the chaotic sounds tho. it kinda sounds like an anti-drop which is
      underwhelming. sometimes my volume mixing is wack lol. also, i really did
      just straight up play songs and stopped them mid song bc they were really
      not the mood when i was playing it live.
      <br /><br />

      lessons learned:
      <ul class="block">
        <li>
          the crowd gets pretty tired after three ~150 bpm songs back to back
          lmao
        </li>
        <li>projector at night üî•üî•üî•</li>
        <li>this is the last time i put laserbeam in a set i promise</li>
        <li>not that good at DJ if blasted ‚úçÔ∏è</li>
        <li>
          i don‚Äôt think this set reflects the style that i‚Äôd play if i were
          playing a DJ set at a nightclub but it‚Äôs one that I thought that was
          fun and something my friends and i would enjoy
        </li>
        <li>
          at the end of the day, i DJ‚Äôed and shared some songs i really liked
          and that‚Äôs all i could really ask for
        </li>
      </ul>
      pls enjoy my set on SoundCloud paired with a deep-fried picture of the
      view outside my SF apartment. i hope you found some new songs you like or
      enjoyed being on the vengabus and let me know if ya did!<br /><br />

      hullo friend, RECORDED THE LIVE SET THIS TIME hell ya but also‚Ä¶ I watched
      this reel on instagram of a classical painting on top of an iPad playing
      subway surfers and I thought the juxtaposition was kinda absurdist funny.
      I was also influenced by this one tiktok where someone‚Äôs on a date and the
      person is not paying attention so the person pulls out their phone with a
      video of subway surfers üôÉ<br /><br />
      <img src="./tiktok-subway-surfers.png" /><br /><br />
      I didn‚Äôt want the set to be like alllll memes bc it might be too cheesy or
      boring. At least I haven‚Äôt figured out how to make it sound good yet. I
      think I just wanted to put something in the set that would remind me of
      what part of culture was influencing me at the time. So I put a super
      crazy hyperpop song next to subway surfers theme. The first part of the
      set I‚Äôm pretty proud of because I tried to see how long I could loop the
      intro to Flim into Sleeves Touch My Elbows. The loop changes mood when you
      bring a more upbeat sounding song into it, kinda hard to describe haha.
      Just listen to it. I want to learn how to build layers and tension into
      sets to control the mood shifts and grabbing people‚Äôs attention with the
      shift. The rest of the set are just songs I really like. The WOBS in the
      mAAd city remix sends me and ofc gotta get that gec 2 √º remix, love the
      cellphone sounds, energy and lyrics. Just kinda random haha. DJing has
      helped me realize which songs I really love and the ones I don‚Äôt like as
      much. It makes me constantly question: ‚ÄúI know what I like but **what do I
      love**?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs missing in the sets I‚Äôm listening to today and what do I
      want to hear?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat music really makes me feel something?‚Äù Lessons
      learned: let the moods change, i press the play button too soon sometimes
      or press the cue button with the volume all the way up haha, don‚Äôt take
      yourself too seriously, it‚Äôs ok to get bored of your own set bc that just
      means you‚Äôre figuring out what you don‚Äôt like and you‚Äôre getting closer to
      your personal sound and style listen to my set on soundcloud and i hope u
      enjoy it. let me know if u did ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî• <br /><br />

      <div class="post-title">the suzhou hotel room set</div>
      hullo friend, this is the first set I‚Äôve posted on SoundCloud but the 4th
      set I‚Äôve made since starting my DJing journey. I had failed to record the
      other sets ü•≤. For this set, I kinda wanted to focus on a specific m00d
      since the sets before felt more like I was focusing on transitioning from
      one song to the next without an overall mood in mind. In my past sets, I
      was just trying to see if I could fit Ray Volpe‚Äôs ‚ÄúLASERBEAM‚Äù into any set
      (it‚Äôs an absolute banger tho). As I listened to more DJ sets, I realized
      that the playlists I was making that would eventually turn into a set was
      getting further and further away from what I felt was ‚Äúme‚Äù and just a
      bunch of songs I liked but still not ‚Äúme‚Äù if that makes sense. I was
      listening to Mura Masa‚Äôs remix of ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Euphoric‚Äù and fell in love with
      the super bouncy bass and its upbeat, euphoric sound so I wanted this song
      to be the anchor of the set. I kept this as the anchor and made my best
      attempt at filling the emptiness of the set that could revolve around that
      vibe. There are definitely some transitions in this set that I wished I
      could‚Äôve done better but the goal of this one was to at least keep some
      sort of vibe without toooooo crazy genre and BPM transitions. In the end,
      I think it was important to focus on mood and not so much the transitions,
      which I know I can get to later. But it was interesting to try to just
      focus on one aspect completely. Another thing I was focusing on was my
      perfectionism. I think it prevented me from shipping a lot of things from
      the fear of the perception that ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing and the stuff
      I‚Äôm making is bad‚Äù. One DJ inspiring me lately is Nikki Nair, he talks
      about ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt need to know what you‚Äôre doing to do this stuff‚Äù hahah
      and that made me feel better. So now I dread the thought of re-recording
      the set just because I was a bit off on the transition. I‚Äôll get it next
      time üòÄ. Just üö¢¬†it. https://youtu.be/i5Lp44zsfUc?t=131 listen to my set
      on soundcloud and i hope u enjoy, let me know if u did (or didn‚Äôt haha
      ü•≤)<br /><br />
